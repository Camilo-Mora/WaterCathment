# Water catchment prototypes of the Carbon Neutrality Project
When it comes down to large scale restoration with native tree species, water availability is truly a key impediment. Without it, tree mortality is huge, and if you have it, the cost of deploying it to individual trees is commonly prohibited given the scale desire.

RainCatcher is a device developed for the purpose of collecting enough rainwater to irrigate individual trees constantly for as long as the device remains deployed. Also, the device is easy to deploy and affordable. Additionally, it can be reused, which reduce cost of irrigation over time. This is a tool in development. The two key goals are to make irrigation accessible in terms of cost for large scale planting operation where maintenance it low to none. 

## Rationale:
RainCatcher is one idea being developed to overcome the massive tree mortality we have when planting trees with volunteers. One can easily capitalize on the manpower of volunteers to plant trees, but the needed irrigation after planting remains a critical limitation to unleash the planting potential of people at large.

There are several products available such as [Nucleario](https://www.nucleario.com/en/) and [Waterboxx](https://www.groasis.com/en/technology/compare-the-anti-desertification-and-reforestation-technology-of-groasis), which are inspired in the same idea. Their problem is that they are still not cost-effective for scaling up; as an example, at the time of this post, waterboxx was around $US20. They are for single use, which means the cost is per tree. If you want to plant say 1 million trees, at $20 per device, irrigation alone will cost you 20 million dollars with this method. 

## Functionality:
The principle of RainCatcher is simple. Collect, store and deploy enough rainwater for a tree to be irrigated at all times; this while making the device simple to deploy and affordable.
